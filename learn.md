## The AGA rating system

- k: Kyu ranks are considered student ranks.
- d: Dan ranks are considered master ranks.
- p: Professional dan ranks.

The AGA system uses numerical ratings. Generally, positive AGA ratings represent dan ranks, and negative AGA ratings represent kyu ranks.

So: 5d > 2d > 2k (-2) > 5k (-5)

| Range  | Stage               |
|--------|---------------------|
| 30–20k | Beginner            |
| 19-10k | Casual player       |
| 9-1k   | Intermediate amateur |
| 1-7d   | Advanced amateur    |
| 1-9p   | Professional player |
